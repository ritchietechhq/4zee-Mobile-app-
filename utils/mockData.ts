/**
 * Mock data module — intentionally empty.
 *
 * This application is fully API-driven. No hardcoded mock data is used.
 * During development, use the backend API or a tool like MSW (Mock Service Worker)
 * to intercept and mock network requests.
 *
 * To set up local mocking:
 * 1. Use your backend's sandbox/staging environment
 * 2. Or configure MSW for offline development
